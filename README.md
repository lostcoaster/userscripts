userscripts
===========

some random user scripts

steamsales.user.js:
-----------
  Script for steam summer sales 2014.

  * Raise notifications when new deals/votes available.

  * Auto vote in the last minute of voting countdown if not voted, to avoid missing votes (and cards coming with it).
  
Functionality requires a userscript extension/addon like TamperMonkey. Because it refreshes page, bookmarklet or console approaches are not feasible.

And store.steampowered.com page must be left open (can be put into background).
  
Tested only in chrome.
  
steamsales_en.user.js:
-----------
  English version of the previous one.
